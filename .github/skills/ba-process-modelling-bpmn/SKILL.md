# BA Process Modelling BPMN

## Operating Approach

Use this skill for BA work in IT outsourcing where the output must be understandable by client stakeholders and actionable for delivery teams.

1. Clarify the business objective, artifact audience, delivery phase, and source evidence.
2. Extract confirmed facts from user-provided files, screenshots, URLs, spreadsheets, diagrams, or bundled reference extracts.
3. Build the artifact using the workflow below and the bundled checklist/template.
4. Separate confirmed requirements from assumptions, recommendations, risks, and open questions.
5. Review the result for traceable IDs, testability, ownership, dependencies, acceptance boundaries, and delivery handoff quality.

## Workflow

- Name the process, business trigger, start event, end event, in-scope actors, systems, and business outcome.
- Capture AS-IS first: activities, decisions, handoffs, data inputs, outputs, controls, timing, exceptions, and pain points.
- Model TO-BE separately and mark deltas instead of quietly replacing current behavior.
- Use business-level BPMN: pools for organizations/systems, lanes for roles, tasks for business actions, gateways for decisions, events for triggers/outcomes.
- Add exception paths, timeout paths, rework loops, manual overrides, and approval/escalation paths.
- End with gap list, automation candidates, integration touchpoints, business rules, data needs, and open questions.

## Output Contract

Always include the following when producing an artifact:

- Context: project/domain/module, audience, source inputs, scope boundary, and confidence level.
- Main artifact: structured tables or sections appropriate to the request.
- Traceability: source reference, requirement/story/use case IDs, screen/API/data references, or decision links where available.
- Quality checks: ambiguity, missing rules, edge cases, NFR/security/privacy/data/test impact, and delivery risk.
- Open questions: grouped by stakeholder or decision area, prioritized by impact.
- Assumptions: clearly marked and ready for client validation.
- Saved artifact location: when asked to save this as a file, write it under `working-artifacts/diagrams/<topic-or-task-name>/` at the workspace root (per the BA Agent's Artifact Output Location rule) unless the user requests a different location.

## Resource Use

- Read `references/checklist.md` when creating a complete artifact, reviewing an existing artifact, or when source material is incomplete.
- Use `assets/output-template.md` as a starting structure when the user asks for a concrete deliverable.
- Prefer the user's provided documents over generic rules. Use bundled reference extracts as pattern memory, not as a substitute for project-specific evidence.
- For regulations, legal obligations, security standards, or current industry rules, verify against current official or authoritative sources before finalizing.

## Quality Bar

- Use business language first, with technical terms only where they affect scope, risk, integration, data, testing, or operations.
- Avoid vague requirements such as "fast", "secure", "user friendly", or "seamless"; convert them into measurable criteria or open questions.
- Do not invent client decisions. If a rule is missing, mark it as an assumption or question.
- Keep outputs tool-agnostic unless the user asks for a specific format such as Word, Excel, Jira, Confluence, Mermaid, BPMN, or Markdown.
